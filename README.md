# LabAndroidProject

In this project, you will develop an android application to help a training center to manage course
offering, registration, and admission process. This center offers short training courses in
different subjects, such as, java programming, C++ programming, python, AI, project management, etc.
There are three different types (roles) of users of this application, (1) center admin (2) trainee
and (3) instructor. The application should support any number of users of each type. It allows the
three users to signup, sign in, and logout. When the application starts, it should pull the most
recently added five courses available for registration from the database.
